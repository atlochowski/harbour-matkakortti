## HSL card reader for Sailfish OS

![icon](icons/86x86/harbour-matkakortti.png)

Application for reading [HSL travel cards](https://www.hsl.fi/en/changecard). The information describing NFC API and data format and even some documentation (in Finnish) can be found [here](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/hsl-card-java).

Obviously, this application only works on those phones where NFC is [supported](https://jolla.com/sailfishx) by Sailfish OS, e.g. Sony Xperia XA2 or Xperia 10.
